# Selenium Testing Library

Simple and complete Selenium testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.

This is a port of [DOM Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) for use in Selenium in a .NET environment.

> This library is still a work in progress. The Testing Library team has not reviewed or endorsed this project, though I do plan to reach out to them.
